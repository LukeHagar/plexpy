# plexpy-example
A basic example of how to use the plexpy package.

## Installation

If `plexpy` is published to pypi:
```sh
pip install plexpy==0.0.1
```

In the event `plexpy` is not published to pypi, you can install it locally by running the following command in the example folder:
```sh
. ./install.sh
```

This will create and start a virtual environment and install the package locally in it.

To close the virtual environment run:
```sh
deactivate
```

To re-activate the virtual environment once it is installed run:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

To run the example, run the following command in the examples folder:
```sh
python sample.py
```
