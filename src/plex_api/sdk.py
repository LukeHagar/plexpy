    r"""Activities are awesome. They provide a way to monitor and control asynchronous operations on the server. In order to receive real-time updates for activities, a client would normally subscribe via either EventSource or Websocket endpoints.
    Activities are associated with HTTP replies via a special `X-Plex-Activity` header which contains the UUID of the activity.
    Activities are optional cancellable. If cancellable, they may be cancelled via the `DELETE` endpoint. Other details:
    - They can contain a `progress` (from 0 to 100) marking the percent completion of the activity.
    - They must contain an `type` which is used by clients to distinguish the specific activity.
    - They may contain a `Context` object with attributes which associate the activity with various specific entities (items, libraries, etc.)
    - The may contain a `Response` object which attributes which represent the result of the asynchronous operation.
